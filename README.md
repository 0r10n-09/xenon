# xenon
Welcome to the TheManStudios' Xenon Github Page.

This is a modified version of the Xenon project from TXG (The Xenon Group) And Orion.
## What is xenon?

Well it's sort of confusing, but i will try to keep it simple.

xenon Is what is described as a "placeboOS", it's a program that tries to act, behave, and look like an OS but is not its own independant OS.

## What are the features?

Well its a pretty small list right now, but we promise to improve.

### Fakeboot:

Its not very good looking for now, but fakeboot basically just makes it feel like your bootinmg into an OS
