# Xenon
Welcome to the official Xenon github!

## What is Xenon?

Well it's sort of confusing, but I will try to keep it simple.

Xenon is what's described as a "placeboOS", it's a program that tries to act, behave, and look like an OS but isn't an independant OS.

## What are the features?

Well it's a pretty small list right now, but as me and my team learn rust, it will get more extensive as we go.

### Fakeboot:

Its not very good looking for now, but fakeboot basically just makes it feel like your booting into an OS

### Xenon cli

Its just our cli, there's nothing special to it, other than it's ours of course.

### Credits

A command to show respect and give credit to the people that made Xenon possible.

### Where can we recomend features?

Why make a pull request of course, or, if you can't code (Which is okay!) you can dm me at orion_0r10n on discord
